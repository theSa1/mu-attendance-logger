# Simple Attendance Logger for Marwadi University Student

This is a simple Typescript Nodejs App that allows marwadi university students to log and access their past attendance, because the MU App apparently dosent let you do that.

This app uses the endpoints used by MU App itself to get the data, and it does not rely on any other source other than once hosted by university itself.

_You are free to expend the project :>_
